Spatial memory and 3D representations are complimentary to video diffusion models across different tasks. This blog post explores different 3D representations and spatial memory techniques used to enhance video diffusion models.

The categories of techniques are defined as follows:

1. Point cloud based representations for novel view synthesis
    - This approaches utilizes initial point clouds to render video from different viewpoints
    - Relevant papers:
