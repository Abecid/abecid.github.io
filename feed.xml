Fundamentals</h2> <p><strong>Flow Matching (FM)</strong> constructs a deterministic coupling between a prior $p_{\text{prior}}(x_1)$ and a data distribution $p_{\text{data}}(x_0)$.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Interpolant:</strong> $x_t = (1-t)x_0 + tx_1$ for $t \in [0, 1]$.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Conditional Velocity:</strong> $v_t(x_t</td> <td>x_0, x_1) = \frac{d}{dt}x_t = x_1 - x_0$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Regress a neural vector field $u_\theta$ against the conditional velocity. \(\mathcal{L}_{FM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, x_1} \|u_\theta(x_t, t) - (x_1 - x_0)\|^2\) At optimality, $u_\theta(x_t, t)$ matches the marginal velocity field. Generation requires iterative numerical ODE integration (many NFEs).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Flow Maps</strong> circumvent iterative integration by parameterizing the flow’s displacement operator.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Definition:</strong> $\psi(x_t, t, s) = x_t + \int_t^s u(x_\tau, \tau) d\tau$.</li> <li><strong>Parameterization:</strong> $f_\theta(x_t, t, s) = x_t + (s-t)F_\theta(x_t, t, s)$, where $F_\theta$ approximates the average velocity over the interval $[t, s]$.</li> </ul> <h2 id="2-progression-of-distillation-modalities">2. Progression of Distillation Modalities</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Trajectory-Based Distillation (Consistency Models, early Flow Maps):</strong> Student directly regresses the teacher’s deterministic ODE trajectory. <em>Limitation:</em> Compounding integration errors and high sensitivity to teacher curvature.</li> <li><strong>Distribution-Based Distillation (DMD, VSD):</strong> Drops strict trajectory matching for direct distributional alignment (e.g., GAN loss, reverse KL). <em>Limitation:</em> Computationally expensive fake score estimation.</li> <li><strong>Data-Free &amp; Analytic Frameworks (FreeFlow, MeanFlow, TVM, MFM):</strong> Eliminate dependency on empirical dataset sampling by anchoring distillation strictly at the prior (FreeFlow), exploiting exact calculus identities (MeanFlow, TVM), or modeling true stochastic posteriors analytically (MFM).</li> </ol> <h2 id="3-core-derivations-and-objectives">3. Core Derivations and Objectives</h2> <h3 id="a-meanflow-exact-average-velocity-matching">A. MeanFlow: Exact Average Velocity Matching</h3> <p><em>Motivation:</em> Derives an analytic identity connecting average velocity to instantaneous velocity, enabling 1-NFE training without a pre-trained teacher.</p> <p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Define average velocity $u(z_t, r, t) = \frac{1}{t-r}\int_r^t v(z_\tau, \tau) d\tau$. Differentiate the integral w.r.t upper limit $t$ using the Leibniz rule: \(\frac{d}{dt}\left[ (t-r)u(z_t, r, t) \right] = v(z_t, t)\) Expand the total derivative $\frac{d}{dt}$: \(u + (t-r)(\partial_t u + v \cdot \nabla_{z_t} u) = v(z_t, t)\) <strong>Objective:</strong> The Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) computes $\frac{d}{dt}u_\theta(z_t, r, t)$. The model regresses $u_\theta$ against the isolated $v_t$ term. \(\mathcal{L}_{MF}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,r,x_0,x_1} \|u_\theta(z_t, r, t) - \text{sg}\left(v_t - (t-r)\frac{d}{dt}u_\theta(z_t, r, t)\right)\|^2\)</p> <h3 id="b-freeflow-data-free-flow-map-distillation">B. FreeFlow: Data-Free Flow Map Distillation</h3> <p><em>Motivation:</em> Static dataset trajectories induce “Teacher-Data Mismatch” under Classifier-Free Guidance. FreeFlow isolates distillation to the prior ($t=1$) where teacher/student distributions are identical.</p> <p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Let $z \sim p_{\text{prior}}$ at $t=1$. Let integration interval be $\delta = 1-s$. The optimal flow map $F_{\theta^*}$ satisfies: \(\delta F_{\theta^*}(z, \delta) = \int_1^{1-\delta} -u(x(\tau), \tau) d\tau\) Differentiate w.r.t $\delta$: \(F_{\theta^*}(z, \delta) + \delta \partial_\delta F_{\theta^*}(z, \delta) = u(f_{\theta^*}(z, \delta), 1-\delta)\) <strong>Objective:</strong> (Predictor-Corrector) \(\mathcal{L}_{pred} = \mathbb{E}_{z,\delta} \left\| F_\theta(z, \delta) + \delta \partial_\delta F_\theta(z, \delta) - u_{\text{teach}}(f_\theta(z, \delta), 1-\delta) \right\|^2\) \(\mathcal{L}_{corr} = \mathbb{E}_{z,\delta,r,\epsilon} \left\| v_{\text{student}}(f_\theta(z,\delta)_r, r) - u_{\text{teach}}(f_\theta(z,\delta)_r, r) \right\|^2\)</p> <h3 id="c-terminal-velocity-matching-tvm">C. Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM)</h3> <p><em>Motivation:</em> Differentiating displacement at the initial bound $t$ ignores terminal geometry. Differentiating at terminal bound $s$ upper-bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance to the data distribution.</p> <p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Displacement $f(x_t, t, s) = \int_t^s u(x_r, r)dr$. Differentiate w.r.t the terminal bound $s$: \(\frac{d}{ds}f(x_t, t, s) = u(x_t + f(x_t, t, s), s)\) <strong>Objective:</strong> Ground-truth terminal velocity $u$ is intractable, so substitute a proxy instantaneous velocity model $u_\theta$, jointly co-trained: \(\mathcal{L}_{TVM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left\|\frac{d}{ds}f_\theta(x_t, t, s) - u_\theta(x_t + f_\theta(x_t, t, s), s)\right\|_2^2 + \|u_\theta(x_s, s) - v_s\|_2^2 \right]\)</p> <h3 id="d-meta-flow-maps-mfm">D. Meta Flow Maps (MFM)</h3> <p><em>Motivation:</em> RLHF/Reward alignment requires $\nabla V_t$, demanding differentiable samples from the stochastic conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(\cdot | x_t)$. Deterministic flow maps collapse this variance. MFM amortizes an infinite family of auxiliary flow ODEs to match $p_{1|t}$.</p> <p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Construct an auxiliary ODE mapping noise $\epsilon \sim p_0$ to $p_{1|t}(\cdot | x_t)$. Parameterize via $\bar{X}<em>{s,u}(\bar{x}; t, x_t) = \bar{x} + (u-s)\hat{v}</em>{s,u}(\bar{x}; t, x_t)$. <strong>Objective:</strong> Analytically derive the true conditional ODE velocity $\bar{b}_s$ via GLASS flows. Match diagonal and enforce self-consistency. \(\mathcal{L}_{diag} = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E} \|\hat{v}_{s,s}(\bar{I}_s; t, x_t) - \bar{b}_s(\bar{I}_s; t, x_t)\|^2 ds\) \(\mathcal{L}_{cons} = \mathbb{E} \|\partial_s \bar{X}_{s,u} + \hat{v}_{s,s} \cdot \nabla \bar{X}_{s,u}\|^2\)</p> <h3 id="e-transition-matching-distillation-tmd">E. Transition Matching Distillation (TMD)</h3> <p><em>Motivation:</em> Video diffusion state spaces are too high-dimensional for direct trajectory distillation. TMD decouples the transformer backbone and flow head, chunking continuous trajectories into few-step discrete probability transitions.</p> <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> Outer transition: $x_{t_{i-1}} = x_{t_i} - (t_i - t_{i-1})y$. Inner flow parameterization: $y_{s_{j-1}} \approx f_\theta(y_{s_j}, s_j, s_{j-1}; m_\theta(x_{t_i}, t_i))$, where $m_\theta$ is the heavy semantic backbone and $f_\theta$ is a lightweight flow head. <strong>Objective:</strong> Stage 1 (Pretraining): Apply MeanFlow objective <em>strictly</em> to the isolated flow head $f_\theta$. \(\mathcal{L}_{TM} = \left\| u_\theta(y_s, s, r; m) - \text{sg}\left(v - (s-r)\frac{d}{ds}u_\theta\right) \right\|^2\) Stage 2 (Distribution Matching): Unroll inner transitions and optimize via variational score distillation (DMD2-v) against the full generative pipeline.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research-survey"/><category term="diffusion"/><category term="survey"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent developments of diffusion distillation techniques]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://abecid.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://abecid.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abecid.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>Learn more:Learn more:Learn more:Learn more:Learn more:Learn more:May 14, 2024 We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
