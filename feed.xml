While Flow Maps have seen great improvements, still distribution matching techniques from an external model (teacher, adversarial) has its strengths and complements. Here recent family of Mean Flow methods are covered along with the classic Score Distillation, Adversarial Distillation, and Consistency Distillation techniques together. Finally recent notable Flow Map techniques addressing different challenges (data free distillation, meta framework), alternative approaches to MeanFlow (TVM) and applications (video diffusion, riemmanian manifold) are addressed.</p> <h1 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h1> <ol> <li><a href="#1-foundations">Foundations</a> <ol> <li><a href="#11-diffusion">Diffusion</a></li> <li><a href="#12-flow-matching">Flow Matching</a></li> <li><a href="#13-rectified-flow">Rectified Flow</a></li> <li><a href="#14-flow-map">Flow Map</a></li> <li><a href="#15-consistency-models">Consistency Models</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#2-meanflow-family">MeanFlow Family</a> <ol> <li><a href="#21-meanflow">MeanFlow</a></li> <li><a href="#22-improved-meanflow-imf">Improved MeanFlow (iMF)</a></li> <li><a href="#23-alphaflow">AlphaFlow</a></li> <li><a href="#24-accelerating-and-improving-meanflow">Accelerating and Improving MeanFlow</a></li> <li><a href="#25-decoupled-meanflow">Decoupled MeanFlow</a></li> <li><a href="">Pixel MeanFlow</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#3-score-distillation">Score Distillation</a> <ol> <li><a href="#31-variational-score-distillation-vsd">Variational Score Distillation (VSD)</a></li> <li><a href="#32-dmd-distribution-matching-distillation">Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)</a></li> <li><a href="#33-score-identity-distillation-sid">Score Identity Distillation (SiD)</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#4-adversarial-distillation">Adversarial Distillation</a> <ol> <li><a href="#41-adversarial-diffusion-distillation-add">Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD)</a></li> <li><a href="#42-ladd-latent-adversarial-diffusion-distillation">LADD</a></li> <li><a href="#43-diffratio">DiffRatio</a></li> <li><a href="#44-apt-and-the-modern-aapt-extension">APT (and AAPT)</a></li> <li><a href="#45-comparisons">Comparisons</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="">Consistency Models</a> <ol> <li>Consistency Models</li> <li>Latent Consistency Models</li> <li>sCM</li> <li>rCM</li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#5-flowmap">Recent Flow Maps</a> <ol> <li><a href="#51-free-flowmap">Free FlowMap</a></li> <li><a href="#52-meta-flow-maps">Meta Flow Maps</a></li> <li><a href="#53-terminal-velocity-matching-tvm">Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM)</a></li> <li><a href="#54-transition-matching-distillation">Transition Matching Distillation (TMD)</a></li> <li><a href="#81-riemannian-manifold">Generalised Flow Maps for Few-Step Generative Modelling on Riemannian Manifolds</a></li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1> <p>Recent generative modeling utilize and develop upon flow maps and jvp based distillation techniques to reduce the number of function evaluations during inference.

Foundations</h1> <h2 id="11-diffusion">1.1 Diffusion</h2> <p>Diffusion models define a <strong>forward noising process</strong> that gradually corrupts data into noise, and a <strong>reverse process</strong> that learns to reconstruct data from noise. The main reason diffusion models became dominant is that they are stable and high-quality, but the tradeoff is <strong>slow iterative sampling</strong>.</p> <h3 id="111-forward-process-discrete-ddpm-view">1.1.1 Forward process (discrete DDPM view)</h3> <p>In DDPM, the forward process is a Markov chain:</p> \[q(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}\!\left(\sqrt{1-\beta_t}\,x_{t-1}, \beta_t I\right),\] <p>where $\beta_t \in (0,1)$ is a variance schedule.</p> <p>A key closed form is:</p> \[q(x_t \mid x_0) = \mathcal{N}\!\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,x_0,\,(1-\bar\alpha_t)I\right),\] <p>with</p> \[\alpha_t = 1-\beta_t,\qquad \bar\alpha_t=\prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s.\] <p>So we can sample $x_t$ directly as:</p> \[x_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}\,\epsilon,\qquad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I).\] <p>This is the standard “data + Gaussian noise” interpolation used in many diffusion derivations.</p> <h3 id="112-reverse-process-and-denoising-objective">1.1.2 Reverse process and denoising objective</h3> <p>The generative model learns the reverse transitions</p> \[p_\theta(x_{t-1}\mid x_t),\] <p>which are parameterized via a neural network (predicting noise, $x_0$, or velocity depending on parameterization).</p> <p>The most common training objective is noise prediction:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{simple}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon} \left[ \left\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t,t)\right\|^2 \right].\] <p>This objective is simple and works extremely well, but inference still requires many reverse denoising steps.</p> <h3 id="113-continuous-time-diffusion-sde-view">1.1.3 Continuous-time diffusion (SDE view)</h3> <p>A continuous-time diffusion can be written as an SDE:</p> \[dx = f(x,t)\,dt + g(t)\,dW_t,\] <p>where $f$ is drift, $g$ is diffusion scale, and $W_t$ is a Wiener process.</p> <p>The reverse-time generative dynamics also form an SDE involving the score:</p> \[\nabla_x \log p_t(x).\] <p>This is the bridge to <strong>score-based generative modeling</strong> and continuous-time transport formulations.</p> <h3 id="114-probability-flow-ode-deterministic-counterpart">1.1.4 Probability flow ODE (deterministic counterpart)</h3> <p>Every diffusion SDE has an associated deterministic <strong>probability flow ODE</strong> that shares the same marginals $p_t$:</p> \[\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,t) - \frac{1}{2}g(t)^2 \nabla_x \log p_t(x).\] <p>This is huge conceptually because it turns diffusion sampling into solving an ODE, which directly connects to:</p> <ul> <li>continuous normalizing flows,</li> <li>flow matching,</li> <li>rectified flow,</li> <li>and later flow-map distillation methods.</li> </ul> <p>So diffusion is not just “denoising noise,” it is also a <strong>continuous transport process</strong> in disguise.</p> <h3 id="115-why-diffusion-motivates-distillation">1.1.5 Why diffusion motivates distillation</h3> <p>Diffusion teachers are strong but slow because generation requires many function evaluations (NFEs).

That means sampling still requires numerical integration:</p> \[x_{t+\Delta t} \approx x_t + \Delta t\,u_\theta(x_t,t)\] <p>(or higher-order solvers like Heun).</p> <p>If trajectories are curved, discretization error accumulates, so many NFEs are needed. This is the main bottleneck that motivates:</p> <ul> <li>Rectified Flow (straighter trajectories),</li> <li>Flow Maps (direct time-to-time transport),</li> <li>and distillation methods (few-step or one-step generation).</li> </ul> <h2 id="13-rectified-flow">1.3 Rectified Flow</h2> <p>Rectified Flow (RF) keeps the ODE/transport framing of FM, but explicitly pushes the learned trajectories to become <strong>straighter</strong>, which makes them much easier to sample with few steps.</p> <h3 id="131-motivation-straight-trajectories-are-cheap">1.3.1 Motivation: straight trajectories are cheap</h3> <p>If a trajectory is highly curved, Euler updates need many small steps. If a trajectory is nearly straight, even a coarse solver can track it accurately.</p> <p>So RF is basically a geometry-aware fix to the FM sampling bottleneck.</p> <h3 id="132-linear-interpolation-path-and-velocity-target">1.3.2 Linear interpolation path and velocity target</h3> <p>A standard RF path is the same linear interpolation:</p> \[x_t = (1-t)x_0 + tx_1,\] <p>with instantaneous derivative</p> \[\frac{dx_t}{dt} = x_1 - x_0.\] <p>RF trains a velocity field to match this transport direction along the path:</p> \[v_\theta(x_t,t) \approx x_1 - x_0.\] <p>A common training objective is:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{RF}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,x_1} \left[ \left\|v_\theta(x_t,t)-(x_1-x_0)\right\|^2 \right].\] <p>This looks similar to FM, but the interpretation is sharper: RF cares about learning a transport field whose induced trajectories are easy to discretize.</p> <h3 id="133-reflow-iterative-rectification">1.3.3 Reflow (iterative rectification)</h3> <p>A major practical idea in RF is <strong>reflow</strong>:</p> <ol> <li>Train an initial transport field.</li> <li>Sample trajectories from the model.</li> <li>Use those trajectories (or endpoint couplings) to retrain a straighter field.</li> <li>Repeat.</li> </ol> <p>Each round reduces curvature and improves few-step generation.
